			Due to the amount of time it takes to convert a site to be Commerce 2003 compatible, there is no Internet upgrade path. You must use the <a href="http://www.pdgsoft.com/Download/Import.exe">PDG Import/Export/Upgrade Utility</a>. This tool is only available for Windows Operating Systems, but it can connect and upgrade any Commerce or Cart 2002 web site regardless of the web server's OS. </td>
