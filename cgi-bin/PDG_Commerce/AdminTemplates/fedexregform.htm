FEDEX END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This license agreement (Agreement) is entered by and between FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (FedEx) and you (Licensee).  

In consideration of the mutual promises and obligations set out below, the sufficiency of which the Parties acknowledge, FedEx and Licensee acknowledge and agree as follows: 

Section 1.  (a) Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, FedEx grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, limited, revocable license, without the right to grant sublicenses, to access and use, within the United States, the FedEx shipping services application (Application), solely as integrated into and made accessible to Licensee as a part of the shipping services system (Software) provided to Licensee by Licensees shipping system supplier (Software Manufacturer), solely to access those shipping and shipping related services offered, from time to time, by FedEx or its Affiliates as incorporated into the Application (FedEx Services) which may include, as the case may be, functionality enabling Licensee to label, rate, route, record, track and invoice shipments tendered to FedEx for carriage on behalf of Licensee and for no other purpose. For purposes of this Agreement, the term FedEx shall mean and include FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. and its parent company, FedEx Corporation, and FedEx Corporations subsidiary companies.  This Agreement governs Licensees access and use of the Application at the physical locations and under the FedEx account numbers and/or registration numbers provided to Licensee by FedEx.  The Application may be accessed and used by Licensee and (through Licensee) by Licensees retail customers that remotely access the Software for the purpose of conducting e-commerce transactions with Licensee and requesting FedEx Services.  Such access by retail customers does not extend to third party shippers or resellers or consolidators of shipping or shipping related services, and except as may be expressly permitted by a separate written agreement between FedEx and Licensee, use of the Application to perform or order FedEx Services by or for the benefit of such parties is prohibited.  To the extent FedEx or the Software Manufacturer makes available to Licensee any updates, upgrades, enhancements, bug-fixes or other modifications to the Application (collectively, Modifications), such Modifications shall be considered a part of the Application and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3.	remove any product identification, copyright or other notices;
4.	transfer the Application or the license, in whole or in part, or grant any rights in the Application or the license, in whole or in part by sublicense or otherwise;
5.	except as allowed under Section 1(a) herein, provide, lease, lend, or otherwise use or allow others to use or have access to the Application or any portion thereof;
6.	disseminate or disclose performance information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) relating to the Application without the prior written consent of FedEx;  
7.	use or display (including, without limitation, doing either on a stand-alone basis (i.e., not as integrated with the Software)) the Application except as expressly authorized in and in accordance with Section 1(a) above; 
8.	reproduce or distribute the Application; or, 
9.	modify or create derivative works of the Application. 

(ii) Licensee shall promptly notify FedEx in writing upon its discovery of any unauthorized use of the Application.

(iii) In addition to the provisions of this Agreement, if Licensee is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government (Government), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Application, manuals, or any technical specifications, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data (Documentation), is further restricted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 227.7202 for military agencies.

(v) Licensee acknowledges that the Software and other services provided by Software Manufacturer are not provided by FedEx, and Licensee waives any and all claims against FedEx arising from or relating to Licensees use of the Software or the other services provided by Software Manufacturer.

Section 2.  (a) Licensee Obligations.  Licensee will follow FedEx's instructions, including those provided in the Application and/or Documentation, provided from time to time, for access and use of the Application.  Licensee is solely responsible for providing and maintaining all hardware necessary to access and use the Application.  In addition, Licensee is solely responsible for obtaining access to the Internet or World Wide Web. Such access is required to utilize the Application.  In addition to such access, the Licensee shall provide FedEx and/or the Software Manufacturer with on-demand remote access to the Application (whether via Internet or dedicated communication line (e.g., telephone))  so that  FedEx and/or the Software Manufacturer may access the Application, from time to time, in order to configure the Application, make Modifications to, recover FedEx Services and related data from, and/or download rating and routing information to the Application as it resides on Licensees systems and/or disable the Application in the event Licensees license is terminated.

Refunds requested by Licensee with respect to any shipment must be made in accordance with the applicable Service Guide.  Licensee will not be entitled to any refund or credit under FedEx's money-back guarantees if FedEx determines that the claim resulted from improper use of the Application.  FedEx, in its sole discretion, may suspend its money-back guarantees in the event Application fails or is inoperable for any reason.

Section 6.  Disclaimer of Warranty.  LICENSEE EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE BY THE SOFTWARE MANUFACTURER AND THAT FEDEX IS NEITHER PROVIDING THE SOFTWARE NOR CHARGING LICENSEE A FEE FOR USE OF THE APPLICATION.
